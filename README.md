TERMINAL APP 1: Terminal diary

OVERVIEW:

The Terminal diary is an ANTI-social media app, for people who want to write about there experience, but don't know who to talk to and don't want to blast there opinions out in to the ether like so many social media applications do.

It checks in with how your day was/is going starting with 3 simple yes or no questions, then asking for a 1 - 10 rating and then prompting you to make a diary entry. Write down anything you want, or split whatever's on your mind over multiple entries. At the end of your entry in the previous-entries.txt file an inspirational quote will also be generated.


FEATURES: 

- 3 "yes or no" questions regarding:
    * stress
    * time management
    * goal orientation
- rating for how your day is going 

take an opportunity to think about your day, how it affected you. 

- ability to write a diary entry

write down how you're feeling, anything you want. whether it's a short sentence or a whole paragraph.

- save the information to a text file on your PC 

The entry is then saved to the previous-entries text file, allowing you to go back and take a look at everything you've put down.
